# Welcome to ChatNMDC!

To directly start chatting with documents in natural language, first choose a document folder in the sidebar.<br><br>
Is there no folder with documents you want to query yet? No problem, it is possible to create your own folder, the application will then create a "vector database" based on the documents in our folder so this extra step will take some time.<br>

It only takes a few steps to create and use your own document folder:
1. In the folder "docs", create a subfolder with a distinctive name 
2. Put any relevant documents you want to chat with in that folder
3. Refresh the screen of this app (shift + F5)
4. Choose the newly created folder in the sidebar and click 'OK'. A "vector database" will be created from your documents. Depending on the size of the folder, this may take some time.
5. Once the creation of the vector database is finished, you can start chatting with your documents<br><br>
