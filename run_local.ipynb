Deelt u voorts de mening dat door te insinueren dat de\\ngedetineerde een verzoek voor hun bezoek moet indienen en dat zij tijdens\\nhet reguliere bezoekuur zouden moeten komen de status van geprivilegieerd\\nbezoek wordt geannuleerd en het daarmee een schoffering van meerdere\\nKamerleden is?', 'Vraag 8\\nWaarom was er sprake van een GRIP-registratie (Gedetineerden Recherche\\nInformatiepunt)?

      "questions: ['Vraag 1\\nHebt u kennisgenomen van de berichtgeving[1 ] aangaande uw rol in het\\ninformeren van de Eerste Kamer over de interpretatie van polymerase chain\\nreaction (PCR)-testen voor het inventariseren van geïnfecteerde en besmette\\nmensen tijdens de coronacrisis?', 'Vraag 2\\nWaarom heeft u de PCR-data die is gebruikt voor het bepalen van de\\ncoronacijfers afgedaan als «irrelevant», terwijl deze data en de manier\\nwaarop die is gebruikt juist cruciaal zijn geweest voor het bepalen van de\\nernst van de pandemie en daarmee dus ook voor het beleid en de maatregelen die daarop gebaseerd werden?', 'Vraag 3\\nWaarom heeft u de Eerste Kamer niet volledig en juist geïnformeerd over de\\ncycle threshold (Ct) die is gebruikt om te bepalen of iemand al dan niet een\\nactieve coronabesmetting had en/of besmettelijk was? En waarom bent u ook\\nniet eerlijk geweest over de amplificatie daarvan, terwijl het «opvoeren» van\\ndeze cycle threshold een aanzienlijk verschil heeft gemaakt in de hoogte van\\nde coronacijfers?', 'Vraag 4\\nKunt u uitleggen waarom u tegen de wetenschappelijke consensus bent\\ningegaan die stelt dat een cycle threshold hoger dan 38 eigenlijk per definitie\\nzorgt voor onbetrouwbare testresultaten? Kunt u deze keuze gefundeerd,\\nmedisch-wetenschappelijk, onderbouwen?', 'Vraag 5\\nHoe rijmt u de informatie die blijkt uit vrijgegeven Wob-documenten, onder\\nandere met betrekking tot een uitbraak in Boxtel, waarin staat dat de hoge\\nCt-waarden waardoor positieve uitslagen werden gegenereerd betekenden\\ndat er dus nauwelijks besmettelijkheid was, met de manier waarop de\\ncoronacijfers zijn gecommuniceerd en met hoe u als Minister de beide\\nKamers hebt geïnformeerd? Waarom hebt u bewust onjuiste en misleidende\\ninformatie verstrekt?', 'Vraag 6\\nWas de Nederlandse overheid zich er vanaf het begin van de coronacrisis van\\nbewust dat de Ct-waarde die werd gehanteerd bij de PCR-test voor het\\ncoronavirus (vaak) (veel) te hoog was? Zo ja, wie wisten dat en wat is er met\\ndeze informatie gedaan? Waarom heeft het kabinet ervoor gekozen door te\\ngaan met deze manier van dataverzameling, terwijl dit niet wetenschappelijk\\njuist en verantwoord was?', 'Vraag 7\\nWas het OMT ervan op de hoogte dat Ct-waarden (vaak) (veel) te hoog waren\\nen wat is hierover besproken in overleggen?', 'Vraag 8\\nIndien een lagere Ct-waarde was aangehouden bij de PCR-testen voor het\\ncoronavirus, hoeveel lager waren de coronacijfers dan geweest? Kunt u\\nhiervan een berekening maken, voor alle vermeende «golven» die Nederland\\nheeft doorgemaakt?', 'Vraag 9 en 10\\nGebaseerd op de correctie gevraagd in bovenstaande vraag, wat voor\\nverschil had dit gemaakt voor het coronabeleid en de maatregelen die zouden\\nzijn genomen? Was Nederland dan nog steeds meermaals in lockdown\\ngegaan en waren andere verregaande maatregelen, zoals de mondkapjesplicht, de schoolsluitingen en de avondklok, dan ook ingevoerd? Zo nee,\\nmoeten wij dan dus concluderen dat Nederland een hele hoop maatregelen\\nbespaard was gebleven als de PCR-testen op de juiste manier waren\\nuitgevoerd en/of geïnterpreteerd?\\nWaarom heeft het kabinet er bewust voor gekozen Nederland een hele hoop\\nschade te berokkenen door maatregelen in te voeren die, gebaseerd op de\\nwerkelijke data, indien deze juist zou zijn geïnterpreteerd, dus helemaal niet\\nnodig waren? Kunt u beargumenteren waarom deze keuze is gemaakt?', 'Vraag 11\\nKunt u inzichtelijk maken welke Ct-waarden tijdens de coronacrisis wanneer\\nzijn gehanteerd en of dat bij ieder testcentrum/ziekenhuis en tijdens iedere\\ngolf hetzelfde was? Kunt u vervolgens ook verklaren wat hiervoor de\\noverwegingen waren en wie daarvoor verantwoordelijk waren?', 'Vraag 12\\nZijn voor gevaccineerde en ongevaccineerde mensen dezelfde Ct-waarden\\ngehanteerd? En hoe zit dit bij (gevaccineerd) zorgpersoneel? Hoe kan het dat\\ner, bijvoorbeeld, in het Radboud UMC, grotendeels gevaccineerd zorgpersoneel al positief getest werd bij zeer lage Ct-waarden? En wat betekent dit voor\\nde effectiviteit van de coronavaccins, aangezien gevaccineerde mensen dus\\npotentieel in sommige gevallen misschien wel veel besmettelijker waren/zijn\\ndan ongevaccineerde mensen, die pas positief testen bij een (veel) te hoge\\nCt-waarde?', 'Vraag 13\\nWaarom bent u tijdens de debatten over de wijziging van de Wet publieke\\ngezondheidszorg Wpg) niet duidelijk en transparant geweest over deze\\nbevindingen en deze data, terwijl dit een groot verschil had kunnen maken in\\nde legitimiteit van het opnemen van de coronamaatregelen in deze wet?', 'Vraag 14\\nWelke Ct-waarden worden op dit moment gehanteerd bij coronatesten en hoe\\ngaat de coronatestdata de komende tijd geïnterpreteerd en getoetst worden?']\n",

Waarom is hier in het geval van Ivermectine bij\\nCOVID-19 een dusdanig groot probleem van gemaakt, niet in de laatste plaats\\nomdat Ivermectine veel minder bijwerkingen geeft dan andere medicatie die\\nwel off-label wordt voorgeschreven, terwijl er daarbij (ook) geen aanwijzingen\\nzijn dat deze effectief zijn voor bepaalde aandoeningen?', 'Vraag 6\\nIs het mogelijk dat het (preventief) inzetten van Ivermectine bij COVID-19\\nmogelijk zou kunnen hebben geleid tot (veel) minder ernstig zieken en dat het\\nvoor (een deel van) de kwetsbare bevolkingsgroep potentieel een adequaat\\nmiddel was geweest om zichzelf te beschermen tegen een heftig verlopende\\nCOVID-19-infectie?', 'Vraag 7\\nZo ja, was het Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport destijds op\\nde hoogte van de mogelijke effectiviteit van Ivermectine om de gezondheid\\nen zorgcrisis te verlichten en indien dat het geval was, waarom is dan geen\\nreal time, dubbelblind onderzoek gestart naar de effecten van Ivermectine bij', 'Vraag 8\\nKunt u uitleggen waarom de Geneesmiddelenwet met betrekking tot het\\ninzetten van Ivermectine tijdens de coronacrisis dusdanig strikt is nageleefd,\\nterwijl dat daarvoor en voor vele andere medicijnen helemaal niet gebeurt?\\nWat waren hiervoor de overwegingen, afgezet tegen de zeer kleine risico’s\\nvan dit middel?

Zo ja, kunt u een juridische onderbouwing geven voor de\\nuitgedeelde boetes van de IGJ aan artsen die Ivermectine voorschreven?', 'Vraag 10\\nGaat het voorschrijven van Ivermectine voor COVID-19 nu ook in Nederland\\nofficieel worden goedgekeurd, volgens de Geneesmiddelenwet?', 'Vraag 11\\nDeelt u de mening dat de communicatie vanuit de overheid over Ivermectine\\nmisleidend is geweest en mensen op het verkeerde been heeft gezet?\\nWaarom heeft u voor deze communicatielijn gekozen, terwijl deze medisch\\nniet juist was?', 'Vraag 12\\nDeelt u de mening dat de overheid zich niet dient te bemoeien met de\\narts-patiëntrelatie en de (behandel)afspraken en overwegingen die daarbinnen worden gemaakt, zolang deze niet bewezen schadelijk zijn voor de\\ngezondheid van de betreffende patiënt en de arts zich houdt aan de medische\\need en gedragscodes?

Welke invloed heeft de zeer\\naanwezige diversiteits- en inclusiviteitsbeweging en de daarmee gepaard\\ngaande cancelcultuur op hen?» Waarop u antwoordde met «Er zijn diverse\\nredenen en oorzaken die leiden tot een verslechterde mentale gezondheid. Er\\nzijn geen directe causale relaties tussen de genoemde maatschappelijke\\nontwikkelingen/ideologieën die worden genoemd in de vraagstelling. Naar\\nmijn weten is er geen onderzoek waaruit dit blijkt.»? Denkt u dat de «schuld»\\nvan racisme en/of slavernij die jongeren meegegeven wordt een zware last, is\\ndie kan leiden tot mentale gezondheidsproblemen?', 'Vraag 14\\nHerinnert u zich uw antwoord op vraag 20 van de eerder gestelde vragen «Ik\\nvind het belangrijk dat jongeren weten waar zij mentale hulp en ondersteuning kunnen vinden en krijgen. Dit gaat gelukkig al vaak goed, maar kan altijd\\nbeter. Zeker nu de mentale gezondheid en het welbevinden onder jongeren\\nonder druk staat. Met de aanpak Mentale gezondheid: van ons allemaal zet ik\\nin om die hulp en ondersteuning zo goed mogelijk te kunnen bieden aan\\njongeren. De doelen van de aanpak gaan over het bespreekbaar en zichtbaar\\nmaken van het belang van mentaal gezond zijn en blijven, het bieden van\\nlaagdrempelige ondersteuning en het bieden van handvatten om met de\\neigen mentale gezondheid aan de slag te gaan. Dit doen we samen met\\nmaatschappelijke partners, het bedrijfsleven en het sociale en culturele\\ndomein. Zo zijn er al interventies en platforms als de «Alles Oké? Supportlijn»\\nen Jongerenhulponline, met als doel: het verbeteren van de mogelijkheden\\nvoor jongeren om op de juiste plek de meest passende anonieme hulp te\\nkunnen ervaren, met een goede verwijzing naar lokale voorzieningen in eigen\\nomgeving als dit nodig blijkt»? Denkt u dat jongeren, door de hoeveelheid\\naan hulplijnen/organisaties die het Nederlandse zorglandschap inmiddels rijk\\nis, door de bomen het bos niet meer zien wanneer zij hulp nodig hebben?']\n",

Is eerst onderzocht of betrokkenheid bij\\neen strafbaar feit kon worden vastgesteld, waarna de waarschuwingsbrieven\\nzijn gestuurd of heeft iedereen die zogenaamd kon worden geïdentificeerd\\neen brief ontvangen?', 'Vraag 3 en 4\\nKunt u gedetailleerd toelichten op welke wijze door de Koninklijke Marechaussee (KMAR) is vastgesteld wie bij deze demonstratie aanwezig waren?\\nWaarom is gekozen voor deze wijze van opsporen? Is hierover overleg\\ngeweest met het OM? Zo ja, wat is daaruit gekomen? Zo nee, waarom is het\\nOM hier niet bij betrokken?\\nKunt u specifiek ingaan op de wijze waarop eventueel gebruik is gemaakt van\\ngezichtsherkenningstechnologie om deze aanwezigheid vast te stellen? Zo ja,\\nkunt u nader toelichten welke foutmarge deze technologie kent, op welke\\nwijze door mensen een verificatie op de uitkomst gedaan is en op welke\\njuridische grondslag een en ander gebeurd is? Is het Nederlands Forensisch\\nInstituut (NFI) betrokken bij het trekken van conclusies op basis van de\\nbeelden en zo nee, waarom niet?', 'Vraag 5 en 6\\nWordt de werkwijze van identificatie zoals die bij de demonstratie is\\ngehanteerd ook in andere situaties gehanteerd? Zo ja, in welke en zo nee,\\nwaarom niet? Hoe is de logging hiervan met oog op de vaststelling van\\nbetrouwbaarheid/bruikbaarheid in een latere fase voor de officier van justitie\\nof rechter?\\nKunnen verdachten geïdentificeerd worden door middel van openbare\\nbronnen, zoals naar waarderingen (likes) en reacties op social media\\nplatformen waarna er foto’s gematcht worden? Vindt u dit een strafvorderlijk\\nverantwoorde wijze van identificatie en opsporing? Gebeurt dit vaker op deze\\nmanier? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?', 'Vraag 7\\nBent u bekend met het feit dat een aantal van deze mensen heeft aangegeven\\ndat zij op 5 november niet in de buurt van Schiphol aanwezig zijn geweest?\\nOp welke wijze is hun verklaring behandeld en gewaardeerd?', 'Vraag 8\\nWaarom is niet gekozen voor een verdachtenstatus maar is ervoor gekozen\\nom de personen als «betrokkenen» aan te merken? Waarom is gekozen voor\\neen term als interview in plaats van «verhoor»? Wat is de strafvorderlijke\\nstatus van een interview? Bent u ermee bekend dat op deze manier bijvoorbeeld geen recht op rechtsbijstand bestaat?', 'Vraag 9, 10 en 11\\nBent u ervan op de hoogte dat het OM heeft aangegeven dat de KMAR hier\\nuitgebreid onderzoek naar zou doen en dat de KMAR (een aantal van) deze\\npersonen vervolgens heeft uitgenodigd? Wist u dat de KMAR deze personen\\nheeft geconfronteerd met foto’s waar deze personen zogenaamd op zouden\\nstaan en heeft aangegeven dat zij zelf bewijs moesten meenemen dat ze niet\\nbij de demonstratie waren?\\nHoe verhoudt deze gang van zaken zich volgens u tot de onschuldpresumptie,\\nzoals wij die in het Nederlands strafrecht kennen? Deelt u de mening dat hier\\nsprake is van omkering van de bewijslast en dat dit in onze rechtsstaat niet\\nde bedoeling kan zijn?\\nVindt u dat mensen kunnen worden verzocht mee te werken aan identificatie\\nals zij niet als verdachte zijn aangemerkt en hen niet wordt verteld waarom zij\\nin het vizier zijn als «betrokkenen»? Welke juridische bescherming hebben\\ndeze mensen precies?', 'Vraag 12\\nKunt u aangeven welke juridische grondslag een waarschuwingsbrief precies\\nheeft? Hoe kan iemand zich verweren tegen zo een brief en/of de melding dat\\niemand «betrokkene» is van een mogelijk strafbaar feit?', 'Vraag 13\\nErkent u dat mensen zowel bij het ontvangen van een waarschuwingsbrief,\\nmaar zeker ook wanneer zij worden uitgenodigd voor nader onderzoek/\\ninterview moeten worden gewezen op hun rechten? Is dit gebeurd en zo ja,\\nwat zijn hun rechten precies? Als dit niet is gebeurd, kunt u uitleggen hoe\\nmensen zich kunnen verweren tegen het onderzoek (zoals het maken van\\nfoto’s voor gezichtsherkenning) van de KMAR?[3 ]', 'Vraag 14\\nOp welke wijze wordt ervoor gezorgd dat de verstrekte gegevens waaruit\\nblijkt dat personen niet aanwezig waren bij de demonstratie alsmede het\\nnoemen van deze personen in systemen van zowel de KMAR, OM als andere\\njustitiële systemen worden opgeruimd? Erkent u dat het genoemd of\\ngenoteerd blijven in systemen die niet goed geïnterpreteerd of overgenomen\\nworden ernstige gevolgen kan hebben en dit te allen tijde voorkomen moet\\nworden? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?', 'Vraag 15\\nWelke actie gaat u ondernemen om te voorkomen dat dergelijke fouten in het\\nvervolg nogmaals worden gemaakt?', 'Vraag 16\\nKunt u toelichten in hoeveel van bovengenoemde waarschuwingsbrieven\\ngekozen is voor een voorwaardelijke sepot?', 'Vraag 17\\nWelke acties heeft u ondernomen naar aanleiding van uw toezeggingen\\ntijdens het mondelinge vragenuur van 13 december 2022 naar aanleiding van\\nkritiek (van de Nationale ombudsman) op de werkwijze van het OM inzake\\nvoorwaardelijke sepots?[4 ]']\n",

Waarom zijn de evaluaties\\nen analyses die Zweden zelf, bijvoorbeeld door de heer Anders Tegnell,\\naangaande het eigen beleid heeft gedaan uit zijn verband en uit de werkelijke\\ncontext getrokken, door te verkondigen dat het land vond dat de gehanteerde\\naanpak gefaald had, terwijl dat niet is wat er daadwerkelijk door bij het\\nZweedse beleid betrokken experts en beleidsmakers werd beargumenteerd?', 'Vraag 6\\nWeet u op welke epidemiologische en virologische data Zweden haar\\ncoronabeleid baseerde en waren deze data anders, of werden deze anders\\ngeïnterpreteerd, dan in Nederland? Zo ja, waarom, met welke verschillende\\n(soorten) data opereerden beide landen en welke discrepanties zitten er\\ntussen de interpretaties van en de gevolgtrekkingen uit deze data?', 'Vraag 7\\nIs het wat u betreft mogelijk dat de aanhoudende oversterfte in Nederland en\\nveel andere landen een gevolg is van enerzijds «uitgestelde»/vertraagde\\nnatuurlijke sterfte van oude en zieke mensen door een infectie met een virus\\nzoals SARS-COV-2, influenza en andere, als gevolg van bijvoorbeeld\\nonnatuurlijke isolatie door de coronamaatregelen en anderzijds een negatief\\ngevolg van de veel te strikte coronamaatregelen die hebben geleid tot schade\\nop vele fronten, waarvan de langetermijneffecten in de vorm van sterfte veel\\ngroter zijn dan de kortetermijneffecten in de vorm van sterfte als gevolg van\\nCOVID-19? Kortom: is het mogelijk dat het Nederlandse coronabeleid\\ncontraproductief heeft gewerkt en nog lange tijd zal doorwerken met\\nbetrekking tot de sterfte in Nederland?', 'Vraag 8\\nOnderschrijft u de analyse in bovengenoemd artikel dat het niet Zweden was\\ndie een «roekeloos en ongeëvenaard experiment» uitvoerde, maar juist de\\nvele andere landen die overgingen tot zware restrictieve maatregelen, die\\ngrote schadelijke gevolgen hadden? Zo nee, waarom niet?

Zo ja, kunt u dit onderbouwen, met een kosten-baten analyse gespecificeerd voor verschillende\\ndemografische groepen en leeftijdscohorten in de Nederlandse samenleving\\nen de gemiddelde volksgezondheid?', 'Vraag 10\\nKunt u een analyse geven van de vraag waarom de Zweedse bevolking uit\\neigen beweging bepaalde verantwoordelijkheden nam en keuzes maakte om\\nverspreiding van het SARS-COV-2 virus te voorkomen, bijvoorbeeld door\\nvrijwillige (tijdelijke) sociale distantie en gerichte bescherming van de\\nkwetsbaren in de samenleving en waarom de Nederlandse overheid van\\nmening was dat de Nederlandse bevolking hiertoe niet in staat en/of bereid\\nwas? Kunt u onderbouwen dat dit daadwerkelijk zo was, of was dit een\\naanname van de Nederlandse regering? Waarom was de Nederlandse\\nregering van mening dat verregaande «gedragsbeïnvloeding» van de burgers\\nnodig was om hen tot bepaalde handelingen te laten komen, of bepaalde\\ngedragingen juist te doen laten?', 'Vraag 11\\nIndien het inderdaad zo is dat de Nederlandse bevolking significant minder\\nvertrouwen heeft in de overheid dan de Zweedse bevolking en dientengevolge minder bereid is om aanbevelingen van de overheid op te volgen, kunt\\nu dan een analyse geven van de oorzaak daarvan en daarin vooral ook het\\neigen aandeel van de Nederlandse overheid meenemen? Erkent u dat de\\nsteeds groter wordende inmenging en controle van de overheid in/op het\\n(individuele) leven van burgers, de verminderende levens- en voorzieningenstandaard en de hoge belastingdruk dit wantrouwen en deze afkeer jegens de\\noverheid in de hand werken?

Zo nee,\\nkunt u dit onderbouwd beargumenteren, aangezien de maatregelen nog altijd\\nniet zijn geëvalueerd, de effectiviteit ervan dus niet is aangetoond, terwijl\\nwereldwijde data inmiddels wel laten zien dat minder maatregelen hebben\\ngeleid tot minder (gezondheids)schade?']\n",

Waarom heeft zowel u,\\nals een vertegenwoordiger van het Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en\\nMilieu (RIVM) aanhoudend aangegeven dat er geen CT-waarden waren,\\nterwijl er nu meer dan 1,2 miljoen verzameld blijken te zijn?[3, 4 ]', 'Vraag 4\\nHoeveel CT-waarden waren voor de kiemsurveillance nodig en als dat er\\nslechts een paar duizend per week waren, kunt u dan uitleggen waar die tot\\nwel 115.000 CT-waarden per week vandaan kwamen op het hoogtepunt van\\nde inzamelingsactie? Welke reden had het verzamelen van zulke grote\\naantallen? Hoe zag de projectorganisatie eruit die deze data opvroeg bij de\\nlaboratoria en verwerkte? Wat werd met die CT-data aan onderzoek gedaan,\\nwat waren de resultaten en wie was de opdrachtgever? Heeft u kennisgenomen van de resultaten en zo ja, hoe zijn deze in het beleid meegewogen?\\nKunt u deze organisatie gedetailleerd inzichtelijk maken?', 'Vraag 5\\nWaarom heeft u deze data niet direct openbaar gemaakt en beschikbaar\\ngesteld voor wetenschappers, onderzoeksinstituten en burgers en waarom\\nbent u niet open en transparant geweest over de beschikbaarheid van de\\nCT-waarden en de gebruikte drempelwaarden voor positief/negatief bij\\ncoronatests?', 'Vraag 6\\nHoe kan het dat u, terwijl er in alle jaren van de pandemie en in 2021 en 2022\\nzelfs systematisch en in groten getale, door het RIVM CT-waarden werden\\nverzameld, zowel de Tweede, als de Eerste Kamer, als het Nederlandse volk\\nen zelfs de Raad van State, steeds verkeerd heeft geïnformeerd en informatie\\nwaar om werd gevraagd heeft achtergehouden?', 'Vraag 7\\nBent u, nu er geen enkele belemmering meer is en gebleken is dat u wel\\ndegelijk zeggenschap heeft over de gecontracteerde labs, althans voor zover\\nhet betreft de omvang van de afgesproken dienstverlening waar deze\\nCT-waarden een cruciaal onderdeel van uitmaken, nu dan wel bereid om alle\\nCT-waarden die tot nu toe in opdracht van Ministerie van Volksgezondheid,\\nWelzijn en Sport zijn geproduceerd door de laboratoria nu wel bij deze', 'Vraag 8, 9, 10 en 11\\nKlopt het dat COVID-19-patiënten in het Amsterdam UMC met een bepaalde\\nCT-waarde uit isolatie werden gehaald, terwijl burgers in de open samenleving bij een positieve test met dezelfde CT-waarde in quarantaine moesten?\\nZo ja, kunt u uitleggen waar deze discrepantie vandaan komt en in welke\\nmate deze testmethodiek heeft geleid tot onnodige quarantaines in de open\\nsamenleving?\\nIs het dan zo dat heel veel mensen in Nederland onterecht, omdat zij niet ziek\\nen niet (meer) besmettelijk waren, in quarantaine hebben gezeten na een\\npositieve test op basis van een bepaalde testmethodiek, terwijl de relatie\\ntussen de positieve testuitslag en de besmettelijkheid niet vastgesteld was\\nbuiten een klinische context? Klopt het dan ook dat de coronamaatregelen die\\nwerden ingevoerd en in stand gehouden onnodig en niet epidemiologisch\\ngefundeerd waren, aangezien de invoering en de vermeende noodzaak ervan\\ngebaseerd waren op het aantal positieve tests, die aan de basis lagen voor de\\ncoronacijfers? Zo nee, kunt u dan uitgebreid uitleggen hoe de noodzaak van\\nde coronamaatregelen beargumenteerd kan worden, als de coronacijfers, die\\nwerden gebaseerd op positieve testen waarvoor de gehanteerde CT-waarden\\nleidend waren, maar blijkbaar in bepaalde situaties van elkaar konden\\nverschillen, en daarmee het verloop en de vermeende ernst van de pandemie, een oneigenlijke basis hadden en de pandemie in de vorm en ernst zoals\\ndie is gepresenteerd door de overheid dus eigenlijk niet bestond?\\nWaarom heeft u de CT-waarden van coronatests bij herhaling afgedaan als\\nmedisch irrelevant, terwijl deze waarden blijkens veel wetenschappelijke\\npublicaties werden toegepast in medische en epidemiologische settings?\\nErkent u dat de pandemie met het meewegen van CT-waarden op epidemiologisch gebied en/of het transparant communiceren hierover, blijkens talrijke\\nstudies en toepassingen in de praktijk in bijvoorbeeld andere landen, beter\\ngeduid had kunnen worden en dat het meewegen van de CT-waarden een\\nbeter inzicht had kunnen verschaffen in het verloop van de pandemie? Of\\nbent u minstens bereid in te zien dat u, met het achterwege laten van de\\nmeeweging van de CT-waarden op epidemiologisch niveau, helemaal geen\\nuitspraken kunt doen over de epidemiologische relevantie?\\nKunt u wetenschappelijk onderbouwen waar de stelling dat CT-waarden op\\nepidemiologisch niveau «irrelevant» zijn op gebaseerd is, als deze nooit in\\nhun geheel zijn opgevraagd en onderzocht zijn en er bovendien verscheidene\\nstudies zijn die die relevantie van deze waarden wel degelijk hebben\\naangetoond? Dat verschillende ijkingen de CT-waarden tussen verschillende\\nPCR systemen moeilijk maken, betekent toch niet dat u a priori de karakteristiek van de genormaliseerde distributie van de samengevoegde CT-waarden\\nafgezet in de tijd als irrelevant kunt afdoen, aangezien u dit niet onderzocht\\nheeft? Laten CT-waarden tenslotte niet een sterke correlatie met besmettelijkheid zien, ongeacht de verschillen tussen polymerase chain reaction\\n(PCR)-systemen van verschillende laboratoria? Is het niet zo dat deze\\nbovendien voor die verschillen gecorrigeerd kunnen worden?', 'Vraag 12\\nZijn de samples, waarvan inmiddels bekend is dat het Ministerie van\\nVolksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport wel degelijk over de CT-waarden\\nbeschikte, representatief voor alle coronatesten, of moesten de door het RIVM\\nbij de labs opgevraagde samples aan bepaalde voorwaarden voldoen? Zo ja,\\nwelke voorwaarden waren dat en waarom was dat noodzakelijk?', 'Vraag 13\\nHeeft het hanteren van te hoge CT-drempelwaarden voor negatief en positief\\nbij coronatests ervoor gezorgd dat zorgpersoneel onnodig, veelvuldig en\\nlangdurig in quarantaine moest en daardoor dus niet beschikbaar was om te\\nwerken, wat de toch al hoge druk op de zorg onnodig heeft vergroot? Zo\\nnee, kunt u dan uitleggen waarom dat niet het geval is, aangezien uit diverse\\npublicaties en Wet openbaarheid van bestuur (Wob)-documentatie afgeleid\\nzou kunnen worden dat veel mensen onterecht in quarantaine hebben\\ngezeten, als gevolg van de hoge drempelwaarden waar iemand nog wel\\nanalytisch positief is, conform de definitie, maar al lang niet meer besmettelijk?', 'Vraag 14\\nWaarom houdt u stelselmatig vol dat de effectiviteit van de coronamaatregelen niet kan worden onderzocht, terwijl u tegelijkertijd cruciale epidemiologische waarden achterhoudt, waarvan de CT-waarden maar een enkel\\nvoorbeeld zijn, die gebruikt zouden kunnen worden voor dergelijk effectiviteitsonderzoek?', 'Vraag 15\\nKunt u uitleggen waarom u de wijziging van de Wpg met de wettelijke\\nverankering van de coronamaatregelen heeft doorgezet, als uw departement\\nwel degelijk in het bezit was van CT-waarden van coronatests en dus ook wist\\ndat die meer inzicht hadden kunnen verschaffen in de epidemiologische en\\nde noodzaak van (verregaande en langdurige) maatregelen in verband met\\neen ernstige/gevaarlijke epidemiologische situatie en de effectiviteit van die\\nmaatregelen? Onderschrijft u dat als deze CT-waarden wel waren gebruikt om\\ninzicht te krijgen in de epidemiologische situatie, wettelijke verankering van\\n(een deel van de) coronamaatregelen misschien onnodig was geweest?', 'Vraag 16\\nKunt u, in het kader van de Wet hergebruik overheidsinformatie, dataminimalisatie en ook het besparen van CO2, alle data voortaan ter beschikking te\\nstellen in een dataformaat, zoals bijvoorbeeld CSV of Excel?', 'Vraag 17\\nHeeft het Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport ingegrepen toen\\nparticulieren bij de Gemeentelijke gezondheidsdiensten (GGD’en) de\\nCT-waarden van hun eigen coronatests opvroegen? Is het niet zo dat\\npersonen altijd recht hebben op inzage in hun eigen medische gegevens?\\nWaarom intervenieert u in de arts-patiënt-relatie?', 'Vraag 18\\nHebben de mensen waarvan de CT-waarden van hun coronatests door het\\nMinisterie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport zijn opgevraagd toestemming verleend voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek met deze gegevens? Zo ja,\\nwaar staat dit geadministreerd?', 'Vraag 19\\nBent u bekend met de inkoopcontracten voor Moleculaire Diagnostiek\\nSARS-CoV-2, waarin feitelijk staat dat positieve testresultaten op onbepaalde\\nmaar korte termijn, binnen een jaar, vernietigd moeten worden? Kunt u\\nverklaren hoe deze clausule zich verhoudt tot zowel de bewaarplicht onder\\nbestaande wetgeving (Burgerlijk Wetboek), als tot de diverse Woo-verzoeken\\nnog lopen op het gebied van CT-waarden?[8 ]', 'Vraag 20\\nBent u bekend met de verstrekte argumentatie van de Raad van State in het\\nHoger Beroep in de CT-Wob zaak, waarin het hoofdzakelijke argument is dat\\ner geen zeggenspraak over de laboratoria zou volgen uit het Memorandum of\\nUnderstanding? Bent u daarnaast bekend met het feit dat er voor de gehele\\nperiode 2020 tot medio 2022 nog diverse Wet open overheid (Woo)-verzoeken\\nzijn gedaan waarvan er een in het stadium van Beroep is en indien de\\nbestuursrechter daarin zou besluiten de gegevens te verstrekken, dit een\\nbelangrijk precedent zou scheppen voor enige latere periode waaronder de\\nperiode waarop genoemde koopovereenkomsten zien?[9, 10 ]', 'Vraag 21\\nKunt u reflecteren op het conflict dat daarbij ontstaat tussen de wettelijke eis\\nvan transparantie en de inhoud van de koopovereenkomst? In het bijzonder,\\nkunt u de logische gevolgtrekking bevestigen dat u een instructie laat uitgaan\\nnaar de contractanten om de betreffende gegevens zeker te stellen, tenminste\\nzolang de Woo-verzoeken en rechtszaken nog in behandeling zijn?']\n",

Zo ja,\\nvindt u dan niet dat wij de wolf geweld aan doen door dit dier in ons land te\\ncultiveren en dat wij daarmee dus eigenlijk schade berokkenen aan de natuur,\\nhet milieu en onze biodiversiteit, onder andere omdat de wolf noodgedwongen over moet gaan tot onnatuurlijk gedrag?', 'Vraag 7\\nHoe bent u voornemens ervoor te zorgen dat Nederlandse landbouwdieren\\nbinnen de rasters blijven na een aanval van een wolf? Onderschrijft u het\\nprobleem dat deze dieren door de aanwezigheid van een wolf op hun terrein,\\nof in hun nabije omgeving, in paniek raken, waarvoor de preventiemaatregelen niet afdoende zijn om ontsnappingen te voorkomen? Onderkent u ook dat\\ner hierdoor gevaarlijke situaties kunnen ontstaan, bijvoorbeeld doordat de\\ndieren de weg op rennen, waardoor er verkeersongelukken plaatsvinden? Als\\nu van mening bent dat de wolf zich blijvend in Nederland moet kunnen\\nvestigen, hoe gaat u dit probleem dan ondervangen?', 'Vraag 8\\nKunt u uitleggen waarom het niet mogelijk is om cijfers en gegevens te\\noverleggen met betrekking tot de DNA-monsters met informatie over de\\nzuiverheid van de wolf?', 'Vraag 9\\nWaarom is er geen (slachtoffer)hulp beschikbaar voor mensen en agrarische\\nondernemers die hun (gezelschaps)dieren verliezen als gevolg van een\\nwolvenaanval?
